  FSD Development:
  
    Write down the simple designs for both FE & BE along with DB.

      Step 1:
        implement the basic UI Design
        along with mocked json
      
      Step 2:
        Write down all the apis needed
      
      Step 3:
        Wire the apis along with the FE
      
      Step 4:
        Handling Errors
